[Verse 1]
C         Em               F        C
Somewhere over the rainbow,  way up high
F       C                        G              Am  F
and the dreams that you dream of once in a lullaby. Ohhhh.

and the dreams that you dream of, dreams really do come true. Ohhhh.
 

[Bridge]
    C
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Em                                 Am   F
wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
      C
Where troubles melts like lemon drops,
Em
high above the chimney tops,
       Am           F
that's where you'll find me, oh
 

[Verse 3]
C         Em               F           C
Somewhere over the rainbow,  bluebirds fly
F       C                            G                 Am F
and the dreams that you dare to, oh, why, oh why can't I? I-I-I, oh
 

[Bridge]
    C
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Em                                 Am   F
wake up where the clouds are far behind me-e-e.
      C
Where troubles melts like lemon drops,
Em
high above the chimney tops
       Am           F
that's where you'll find me, oh
 

[Verse 3]
C         Em               F        C
Somewhere over the rainbow,  way up high
F       C                        G                 Am F
and the dreams that you dare to, why, oh why can't I? I-I-I
